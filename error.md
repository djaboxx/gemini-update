## Remediation Plan: Resolve ImportError for 'AnalysisResult'

**Issue:** `ImportError: cannot import name 'AnalysisResult' from 'src.models'`

**Summary of Error:**

The application failed to start due to an `ImportError`. The module `src/agent/agents.py` attempted to import the name `AnalysisResult` directly from the `src.models` package, but this name was not found or exposed at the package level.

**Root Cause Analysis:**

The `src.models` package uses an `__init__.py` file to control which names are exposed when the package is imported. The stack trace and examination of `src/models/__init__.py` revealed that `AnalysisResult` is neither imported into `__init__.py` from its defining module (likely `src/models/analysis.py`) nor included in the `__all__` list. Consequently, `AnalysisResult` is not available for direct import using `from src.models import AnalysisResult`.

**Files and Code Changes:**

The fix requires modifying the `src/models/__init__.py` file to correctly expose `AnalysisResult`.

1.  **File:** `src/models/__init__.py`

2.  **Code Changes:**

    *   **Add `AnalysisResult` to the import from `src.models.analysis`:**
        Modify the existing import statement for `src.models.analysis` to include `AnalysisResult`.

**Additional Context:**

In Python, when you import directly from a package (e.g., `from package import name`), Python looks for `name` within the package's `__init__.py` file or as a submodule of the package. The `__all__` list in `__init__.py` explicitly defines the public interface of the package when using `from package import *`, but it also affects what names are discoverable for direct imports in some contexts and is good practice for clarity. By importing `AnalysisResult` into `src/models/__init__.py` and adding it to `__all__`, we make it available for other modules (like `src/agent/agents.py`) to import directly from `src.models`.

Applying these changes to `src/models/__init__.py` will resolve the `ImportError`.
