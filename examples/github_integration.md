# GitHub Integration for gemini-update

This feature enhances gemini-update by providing seamless GitHub integration, allowing users to create GitHub issues directly from implementation plans.

## Overview

The gemini-update agent already excels at analyzing codebases, generating feature specifications, and producing detailed implementation plans. This new GitHub integration feature bridges the gap between planning and execution by converting implementation plans into GitHub issues that development teams can track and implement.

## Use Cases

1. **Streamlined Feature Implementation**: Convert the AI-generated implementation plans into actionable GitHub issues with a single command.

2. **Task Breakdown**: Automatically split complex implementation plans into multiple task-specific GitHub issues for better tracking and delegation.

3. **Cross-Team Collaboration**: Share implementation plans with team members who prefer working with GitHub's issue tracking system.

4. **Documentation Preservation**: Maintain a permanent record of implementation plans alongside the actual code changes in your GitHub repository.

## Feature Details

The GitHub integration provides:

- Creation of a main GitHub issue containing the complete implementation plan.
- Optional creation of separate task issues for each implementation step.
- Customizable labeling of GitHub issues.
- Linking between task issues and the main implementation plan issue.
- Both CLI and API interfaces for creating GitHub issues.

## Usage

### Command-Line Interface

```bash
# Create GitHub issues from an existing implementation plan
./gemini-update.py github \
    --implementation-plan-path /path/to/implementation_plan.md \
    --repo-owner your-github-username \
    --repo-name your-repository-name \
    --create-task-issues \
    --labels enhancement gemini-update

# Create a feature specification and implementation plan, then send to GitHub
./gemini-update.py feature \
    --project-dir /path/to/your/project \
    --feature-description "Add dark mode support to the UI components" \
    --github-integration \
    --repo-owner your-github-username \
    --repo-name your-repository-name
```

### Using Environment Variables

You can set GitHub authentication using environment variables:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_github_token"
```

## Requirements

- A GitHub account with appropriate permissions to create issues in the target repository.
- A GitHub personal access token with the `repo` scope.
- The `requests` Python package (automatically installed with gemini-update).

## Benefits

- **Save Time**: Eliminate the manual work of creating GitHub issues based on implementation plans.
- **Consistency**: Ensure that GitHub issues accurately reflect the AI-generated implementation plan.
- **Traceability**: Maintain clear connections between features, implementation plans, and actual GitHub issues.
- **Enhanced Workflow**: Create a smooth workflow from feature conception to implementation tracking.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Integration with GitHub Projects**: Automatically add created issues to GitHub Projects.
2. **Milestone Association**: Link issues to specific milestones.
3. **Pull Request Templates**: Generate pull request templates based on implementation plans.
4. **Custom Issue Templates**: Support for repository-specific issue templates.
5. **Status Updates**: Update issue statuses based on implementation progress.
