# Feature Specification: Create GitHub Issue from Implementation Plan

**Type:** integration
**Priority:** high

## Description

Add functionality to generate and create a GitHub issue directly from a generated implementation plan, pre-populating the issue with details from the plan.

## User Personas

- Developer
- Project Manager
- Technical Lead

## Requirements

### req-1: user-story

As a user, I want to create a GitHub issue directly from a generated implementation plan so that I can quickly turn the plan into an actionable task.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- A clear option/button is available after an implementation plan is generated to "Create GitHub Issue".

### req-2: functional

The system shall format the implementation plan details into a suitable GitHub issue body.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The issue body includes the feature description, estimated complexity, affected files, new files, and a structured list of changes from the implementation plan.
- Markdown formatting should be used for readability in the issue body.

### req-3: functional

The system shall generate a descriptive title for the GitHub issue based on the feature name.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The generated issue title is clear and includes the feature name (e.g., "Implement Feature: [Feature Name]" or similar).

### req-4: functional

The system shall allow the user to select the target GitHub repository.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- A mechanism (e.g., dropdown, input field) is provided for the user to specify the repository (owner/repo-name).

### req-5: technical

The system shall integrate with the GitHub Issues API to create the issue.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- A successful API call is made to `POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues` with the generated title and body.

### req-6: non-functional

The system shall handle GitHub authentication securely.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The user is prompted to authenticate (e.g., via OAuth or Personal Access Token) if not already authenticated.
- Authentication details are handled securely.

### req-7: functional

The system shall notify the user of the outcome of the issue creation attempt.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- A success message with a link to the newly created GitHub issue is displayed upon success.
- An informative error message is displayed if issue creation fails (e.g., authentication error, API error, invalid repository).

### req-8: technical

The system shall handle potential GitHub API rate limits gracefully.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system should implement retry logic or inform the user if rate limits are encountered.

## Success Metrics

- Percentage of implementation plans converted into GitHub issues using the feature.
- Average time saved in creating GitHub issues compared to manual creation.
- User satisfaction score related to the issue creation workflow.

## Technical Notes

Requires integration with the GitHub API. Authentication mechanism (OAuth or PAT) needs to be implemented. Consider UI/CLI elements for selecting the repository and initiating the action. Error handling for API calls and rate limits is crucial.
