# Feature Specification: Create GitHub Issue from Implementation Plan

**Type:** integration
**Priority:** medium

## Description

Allows users to generate a GitHub issue directly from a generated implementation plan, populating the issue with details from the plan.

## User Personas

- Developer: Needs to quickly create issues for planned work.
- Project Manager: Wants to ensure planned features are tracked in the project's issue board.
- Team Lead: Oversees task creation and assignment based on implementation plans.

## Requirements

### req-1: user-story

As a user, I want to create a GitHub issue directly from an implementation plan so I can easily track the work in my project's issue tracker.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system provides a clear way to initiate GitHub issue creation from an implementation plan.
- The created GitHub issue accurately reflects the content of the implementation plan.

### req-2: functional

The system shall provide a user interface element (e.g., button) to trigger the GitHub issue creation process from an implementation plan view.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- A button or link labeled 'Create GitHub Issue' is visible on the implementation plan view.
- Clicking the element initiates the issue creation workflow.

### req-3: functional

The system shall prompt the user for necessary information (e.g., GitHub repository, title prefix, assignees, labels) required to create the issue, if not pre-configured.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- A modal or form appears prompting the user for required GitHub issue details.
- The user can select or input the target GitHub repository.
- The user can optionally specify assignees and labels.

**Dependencies:**

- req-2

### req-4: functional

The system shall authenticate with GitHub using the user's credentials or a configured integration.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system successfully connects to the user's GitHub account.
- API calls to GitHub are authorized.

### req-5: functional

The system shall format the GitHub issue title using the feature name from the implementation plan, potentially with a configurable prefix.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The title of the created GitHub issue includes the feature name from the implementation plan.
- If a prefix is configured/provided, it is included in the issue title.

**Dependencies:**

- req-3

### req-6: functional

The system shall format the GitHub issue body using the implementation plan details (description, scope, changes, estimated complexity).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The body of the created GitHub issue contains the implementation plan description.
- The issue body includes details about affected files, new files, and changes.
- The estimated complexity is mentioned in the issue body.

**Dependencies:**

- req-3

### req-7: functional

The system shall create a new issue in the specified GitHub repository via the GitHub API.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- A new issue appears in the selected GitHub repository.
- The issue is created with the formatted title and body.
- Assignees and labels (if specified) are applied to the issue.

**Dependencies:**

- req-4
- req-5
- req-6

### req-8: functional

The system shall display a confirmation message upon successful issue creation, including a link to the new issue on GitHub.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- A clear success notification is shown to the user.
- The notification includes a clickable link that opens the newly created GitHub issue in a new tab.

**Dependencies:**

- req-7

### req-9: functional

The system shall display an informative error message if issue creation fails (e.g., authentication failure, invalid repository, API error).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- If issue creation fails, an error notification is displayed.
- The error message provides context about why the creation failed (e.g., 'Authentication failed', 'Repository not found', 'API rate limit exceeded').

### req-10: non-functional

The integration should handle GitHub API rate limits gracefully, potentially informing the user or implementing retry logic.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system does not crash when hitting GitHub API rate limits.
- The user is informed if a rate limit prevents issue creation, or the system retries if appropriate.

### req-11: non-functional

GitHub authentication details (e.g., Personal Access Tokens or OAuth tokens) shall be stored and handled securely.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Authentication tokens are encrypted at rest.
- Authentication tokens are not exposed in logs or client-side code.
- Standard security practices for handling credentials are followed.

### req-12: technical

Implement a client for interacting with the GitHub REST API (v3 or v4).

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- A dedicated module or class exists for GitHub API communication.
- API calls for issue creation are correctly structured.

### req-13: technical

Implement the necessary authentication flow (e.g., using Personal Access Tokens or OAuth Apps) to authorize API requests.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- The system can successfully authenticate with GitHub.
- The chosen authentication method is implemented correctly.

**Dependencies:**

- req-11
- req-12

### req-14: technical

Map the data structure of the implementation plan to the required payload format for creating a GitHub issue.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- A clear mapping exists between implementation plan fields and GitHub issue fields (title, body, etc.).
- The issue body is formatted correctly using Markdown.

**Dependencies:**

- req-6
- req-7

### req-15: technical

Implement robust error handling for GitHub API calls, providing specific feedback based on API responses.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- Specific error codes from the GitHub API are handled.
- Error messages displayed to the user are derived from API responses where possible.
- Edge cases like repository not found or permission issues are handled.

**Dependencies:**

- req-9
- req-12

## Success Metrics

- Percentage of implementation plans successfully converted to GitHub issues.
- Average time saved by users when creating issues using this feature compared to manual creation.
- Number of users who utilize the feature within the first month of release.
- User satisfaction score related to the GitHub integration.

## Technical Notes

Integration will require using the GitHub REST API (v3 or v4). Authentication can be handled via Personal Access Tokens (PATs) stored securely by the user or potentially via an OAuth App flow. Need to consider how the target repository is selected/configured (per-project setting, user input per issue). The implementation plan content will need to be formatted into Markdown for the issue body. Need to handle potential size limits for the issue body content. Robust error handling for API calls is crucial.
